# Intro
Hey everyone. This is **Pritam Mishra** from first year of **ECE** dept. of National Institute of Technology, Trichy. I hail from Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I learnt Java in class 9th and 10th and basics of C language in the first semester. I have been picking intrest in coding since the firt semester.                                  
My hobbies include :
1. playing keyboard(the musical instrument)

I like trying out new things and putting in efforts to reach a near perfection level. I see responsibilities as new challenges instead of burdens. Presently I am in *Film Soceity of NITT* but I am ready to give it up if I am selected in Spider club beacuse I believe I will be learning a lot by being a part of both induction process as well as a member of the club.
>I desire to cultivate a good deal of programming culture through these procedures. I am really excited after talking with some of the seniors about the advantages of being the part of this induction process and what things I can gain here. I will make sure that I learn as much as things possible from this process.:innocent: :smiley_cat:

My **strengths** include being self motivated and having a keen interest to learn new things
